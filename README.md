# Crick-It
The fantasy sports genre includes Crick-IT. It is an online game where players create a virtual team of real cricket players, and points are awarded based on how well they perform in actual matches. Players must strive to accumulate the most points and the top leaderboard position in order to win a tournament.

Crick-IT is a hybrid of Cricket and video games where we can watch the players' live performances in real-time with just one restriction: we cannot alter their performances because each player's performance is solely dependent on their prior performances, the opposition, the pitch (ground), and the position they are playing in.

The batting and bowling orders, which are the most contentious aspects of cricket strategy, constitute the foundation of a Crick-IT match. The outcome of the game can be changed by a slight adjustment to the sequence. The idea is to pick a squad of 11 players plus 3 substitutes from the participants who take part in the game. Although in certain fantasy programmes you can only form teams in accordance with their requirement patterns, there are no budget limitations and player selection is not constrained to a specific amount of batters, bowlers, and all-rounders. Five hitters, one wicketkeeper, two all-arounders, and three bowlers are a few examples of their suggested lineup. Any player type is acceptable for a fantasy squad.
